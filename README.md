# Countries Composition

A small SuperCollider project that was a part of my Sonic Art Composition degree. To run, download the [SuperCollider platform](https://supercollider.github.io/), boot the server `(Command + B)`, and then load in the synth definitions and buffer `(Command + Enter)` blocks, before finally running the `PSeq` at the bottom using the same command.
